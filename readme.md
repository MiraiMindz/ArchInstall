# Arch Linux Install Script Written in Go

![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/MiraiMindz/ArchInstall?style=flat-square)

Welcome to my project of creating a universal Arch Linux install script in Go \[CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT\]

This script aims to fully automate the hard-labour of typing a lot of commands while maintaining the DIY approach of Arch Linux, in other words this script is a easy-to-use/idiot-proof installer; and it ensures some UNIX standards aswell (like hostname and username conventions and rules).

*Why I called it 'universal' you might ask?* This is because it aims to install Arch on the most common ways (and some uncommon ones), I've scrapped the wiki for "Installation Methods" to bundle them here, currently it has only 3 methods:
- PC (Your usual installation)
- Server (Is self-explanatory)
- Removable Medium (Install Arch on a removable medium like a USB stick and make the proper configurations)
